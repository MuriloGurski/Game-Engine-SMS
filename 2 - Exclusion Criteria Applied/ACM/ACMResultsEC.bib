abstract = {Programming grants individuals the capability to design, create, and bring ideas to life. To improve their skills, programmers require powerful languages and programming environments for understanding the impact of gradual code changes. We investigate how modern game engine technology can be leveraged for creating visual input and feedback mechanisms that drive exploratory and live programming.  In this paper, we report experiences on creating a visual programming environment for Machinations, a domain-specific language for game design. We share initial findings on how to automate the development of graph- and tree- based editors in Godot, an open source game engine. Our results show that today’s game engine technology provides a solid foundation for future programming language research.},

abstract = {In video game development, bug detection and reproduction are crucial for productivity. Automating these tasks has been a longstanding goal in the industry to reduce quality management costs. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers avenues for automation, its integration into the game development cycle is often cost-prohibitive.This paper presents a novel detection technique that leverages data readily available from the game engine and a time-saving tool for bug reproduction. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in the bug detection and reproduction workflow, reducing the time spent by testers and developers by one-third compared to manual methods without compromising on manual testers' detection accuracy.The primary aim of this paper is to introduce the technique and validate its compatibility with game engine workflows. Utilizing the Unity engine, the developed tool specifically targets camera clipping bugs. Thus, the proposed technique, while effective, is somewhat limited in scope. For broader applications, source code adaptations are necessary to integrate with other game engines and detect various bug types.},

abstract = {Game engines are primarily designed for the development of video games but can also be used as rendering engines for 2D and 3D graphics. They include all relevant libraries and supported programs. Developers can use them to construct games for game consoles and other types of computer softwares. They also aid in the porting of games to multiple platforms. Developers look for platforms which are easily available and provide facilities to create impressive, interesting and animated games. But these software are difficult to run on everyday machines, especially laptops, limiting their use to professionals with dedicated systems. This paper discusses design of new game engine with all the standard features of a rendering engine. The artificial intelligence (AI) aspect of the engine requires rendering of visual data at a lower resolution to improve performance and then using trained Deep Networks to upscale the image to the native resolution of the user's monitor. The AI will ensure that upscaling will be adding detail rather than averaging the nearby pixels.CCS CONCEPTS • Software and its engineering • Software creation and management • Designing software • Software implementation planning • Software design techniques},

abstract = {By leveraging cloud computing resources, cloud gaming, also known as Games-as-a-Service (GaaS), has emerged as a new computer game delivery paradigm that promises gaming anywhere, anytime, on any device. In this regard, game engine architectures are one of the main objects of study when adapting digital games to cloud gaming. However, most of the proposed cloud gaming architectures cannot take full advantage of cloud computing resources to offer system scalability due to a monolith design. In this paper, we evaluate the impacts of a distributed architecture in terms of system performance by employing the service-oriented architecture paradigm to offload the game physics calculations as a decoupled system. As a differential, our work contributes to the discussion by implementing a proof-of-concept to compare the game engine performance between the monolith and distributed approaches by utilizing a modern public cloud provider, which as far as we know, has not yet been done in the literature. As a result, the distributed approach had a better performance in computation-intensive physics calculations scenarios. In this case, the communication overhead is outweighed by performance gains, as the physics engine was deployed on a compute-optimized VM. This further indicates the benefits of decoupling game engine systems, not only better game performance but also taking a step further for a scalable cloud gaming system, which can scale better both vertically and horizontally.},

Starting from an era where a single developer was in charge of the whole creative process, we have moved now toward extremely large groups with a multi-layered organisation. Moreover, today’s game engines suffer from a number of architectural constraints, and will not likely be able to meet the flexibility and scalability required by game developers of the next generation. This increasing complexity, the tremendous growth of projects size, and the rapidly evolving AR/VR trend, call for the adoption of agile development and cost-effective management approaches leveraging on distributed computing environments and primitives. In this work, we present the concept of a distributed game engine architecture, which relies on a resource-aware middleware solution providing run-time quality support to components spanning edge-cloud environments.},

abstract = {Depth maps are needed by various graphics rendering and processing operations. Depth map streaming is often necessary when such operations are performed in a distributed system and it requires in most cases fast performing compression, which is why video codecs are often used. Hardware implementations of standard video codecs enable relatively high resolution and frame rate combinations, even on resource constrained devices, but unfortunately those implementations do not currently support RGB+depth extensions. However, they can be used for depth compression by first packing the depth maps into RGB or YUV frames. We investigate depth map compression using a combination of depth map packing followed by encoding with a standard video codec. We show that the precision at which depth maps are packed has a large and nontrivial impact on the resulting error caused by the combination of the packing scheme and lossy compression when the bitrate is constrained. Consequently, we propose a variable precision packing scheme assisted by a neural network model that predicts the optimal precision for each depth map given a bitrate constraint. We demonstrate that the model yields near optimal predictions and that it can be integrated into a game engine with very low overhead using modern hardware.},

abstract = {Here, we are focusing on how our real-time visualizations are being used to improve the QA/QC process. While the AEC industry has utilized 3D CAD design software for years, the review process still typically involves commenting on printed 2D drawings or PDFs. We have developed a QA/QC tool that allows our engineers and project managers to review designs in real-time 3D, placing comment markers in 3D space for others to see. Built in Unity, this tool supports viewing and commenting on everything from individual CAD models and components to sprawling miles-long infrastructure projects, with all markup data being stored securely in the cloud for easy access to authorized contributors.This is opposed to the traditional method, which involved building a 3D environment, rendering a video, sending it out for review, then having the review team take screenshots and compile it in a PDF. By allowing reviewers to mark up the 3D environment directly, we are drastically speeding up the iteration process. In addition, users have better insight into the current status of revisions as markups can be configured to different stages of completion as updates are made and the project evolves. We have also added multi-user capabilities – using game engine networking functionality allows for multiple users to be in the tool at once, interacting and communicating within the same environment together in real-time. And our tool is able to be built for multiple platforms, so users can access and interact with it using web, mobile devices, VR, etc. As a result, not only does using a real-time game engine speed up the QA/QC process, it also opens new opportunities for improved communication and collaboration.},

We have identified a 33M-parameter small Language Model (LM), TinyStories [Eldan and Li 2023], repurposed it to be conversational, and combined it with the standard Unity Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) ML-Agents [Juliani et&nbsp;al. 2020] model. The LM drives the interaction with the user, while the MLP performs the actions. A Sentence Similarity model [Reimers and Gurevych 2019] is then responsible for filtering user input to decide whether the NPC needs to communicate with the player or to perform an action. Running all these models locally on mobile inside a game engine like Unity can be very challenging in terms of optimization, but this poster demonstrates how it is possible.},

abstract = {Abstract: The development of science and technology has led to the development of the game industry. As the mainstream development engine of the current three-dimensional game, UE4 is popular with game developers for its powerful rendering technology and model processing technology. There will be a large number of non-player characters (NPC, non-player character) in the game, and these AI-controlled characters are an important way for developers to interact with users. Among them, pathfinding is the most important part of the game's AI character, which gives the AI character vitality, so that the AI character can interact with the player, chase, and automatically complete the movement to the target point. Pathfinding is the core function of an AI character, and there are many current pathfinding methods, such as Dijstra algorithm, best-first search algorithm, A-star algorithm. Most of these pathfinding algorithms are used in 2D static maps, but there is no detailed description of 3D pathfinding by pathfinding algorithms in UE4. This paper first introduces and compares several map pathfinding models, then experimentally compares different pathfinding algorithms, and then uses blueprint programming to implement AI role pathfinding in the three-dimensional map in UE4 based on the optimal performance algorithm. Finally, the overall experimental results are summarized and sorted out, and the direction for future development is pointed out.},

NMTs are often developed as bulky stand-alone applications, for example, using game engines, which make them difficult to integrate into the LMS courses. Thus, connecting middleware technologies are needed, however, various technologies exist. In this paper, we introduce three techniques (SCORM-Data, xAPI-Injection, and JSON-REST) that integrate stand-alone NMT learning software into LMSs based on existing technologies and standards from the E-Learning domain. We discuss the techniques and their underlying processes based on a prototype implementation and the results of an expert interview and point out the advantages and disadvantages of each technique to give practitioners differentiated advice on which technique to use. Although SCORM-Data has fewer technical requirements, we conclude that our JSON-REST technique was favored through applicability, simplicity, ease of integration, and efficiency.},

As personal computers grew in popularity, developers jumped at the opportunity to deploy cross-platform games with centralized management and a low barrier to entry. Simply going to the right address is now enough to start a game. From text-based to GPU-powered 3D games, browser gaming has evolved to become a strong alternative to traditional console and mobile-based gaming, targeting both casual and advanced gamers. Browser technology has also evolved to accommodate more demanding applications, sometimes even supplanting functions typically left to the operating system. Today, websites display rich, computationally intensive, hardware-accelerated graphics, allowing developers to build ever-more impressive applications and games. In this paper, we present the evolution of browser gaming and the technologies that enabled it, from the release of the first text-based games in the early 1990s to current open-world and game-engine-powered browser games. We discuss the societal impact of browser gaming and how it has allowed a new target audience to access digital gaming. Finally, we review the potential future evolution of the browser gaming industry.},

That is why most water visual effects in modern games are either simulated as only a 2D shallow-water in which simulation is calculated in 2D grid and projected onto the heightfield, as in [Fluid Flux 2022], or are baked at preprocessing stage which does not allow the player to dynamically interact with the liquid at runtime, as a result, lots of the fun of interactivity is lost.This course will discuss the state-of-the-art and production-proven techniques involved in building a real-time system on GPUs for simulation and rendering of realistic 3D liquid with millions of particles. It also discusses how to integrate the system into modern game engines (like UE5), with some show-cases of real applications in gaming environments.},

abstract = {The majority of research at the intersection of AI and video games focuses on developing agents capable of playing games without human input, or developing AI game enemies. The research in this paper explores a counter approach, whereby a player trains an a AI partner during game play and learns to play cooperatively with the agent. We created a 2D video game that allows the player to cooperate with an AI agent manipulated by two underlying algorithms, either with reinforcement learning or a random process. For our reinforcement learning approach we used a Q-learning table, that is updated based on the player. We found that players engaged strongly with the idea of training their own custom AI agent and believe this shows significant potential for future exploration.},

The one-day workshop has been held as part of the 46th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2024) in Lisbon, Portugal on April 14, 2024. The workshop programme includes two exciting keynotes discussing topics related to harnessing video game simulations to generate content and locate bugs, and the experience of maintaining a popular FOSS library, raylib. There are three research paper sessions. The first relates to automation in game engineering; the second explores testing and quality assurance; and the third discusses specification and quality of service. The conclusion of the workshop is anchored by a panel of four researchers, educators, and practitioners discussing the current strengths and limitations of large language models in game engineering.},

abstract = {Physiological measurement of player experience (PX) during gameplay has been of increasing interest within game research circles. A commonly-used non-invasive wearable device for physiological measurement is the Empatica E4 wristband, which offers multiple physiological metrics, ranging from electrodermal activity to heart rate. That said, the E4’s integration with popular game engines such as Unity 3D presents certain challenges due to non-obvious critical bugs in the library and limited documentation applicability within the Unity context. In this paper, we present an open-source Unity plug-in designed to mitigate the challenges associated with integrating the E4 into Unity projects: E4UnityIntegration-MIT. The plug-in exposes the E4’s API for interfacing with Unity C# scripts, thereby enabling realtime data collection and monitoring. E4UnityIntegration-MIT also provides the affordance of saving the E4 data into an external file for data analysis purposes.},

abstract = {To assist game developers in crafting game NPCs, we present EvolvingBehavior, a novel tool for genetic programming to evolve behavior trees in Unreal®Engine 4. In an initial evaluation, we compare evolved behavior to hand-crafted trees designed by our researchers, and to randomly-grown trees, in a 3D survival game. We find that EvolvingBehavior is capable of producing behavior approaching the designer’s goals in this context. Finally, we discuss implications and future avenues of exploration for co-creative game AI design tools, as well as challenges and difficulties in behavior tree evolution.},
