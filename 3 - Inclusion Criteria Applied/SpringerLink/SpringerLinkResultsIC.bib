	abstract = {Game development is different from traditional software engineering in that there are no real functional requirements and the customers buy and use the software only because it is engaging and fun. This article investigates how game developers think about and use software architecture in the development of games. Further, it looks at how creative development processes are managed and supported. The results presented in this article come from responses to a questionnaire and a survey among thirteen game developers. The research questions answered in this study are: what role does the software architecture play in game development, how do game developers manage changes to the software architecture, how are creative development processes managed and supported, and how has game development evolved the last couple of years. Some of our findings are that software architectures play a central role in game development where the focus is mainly on achieving software with good performance and high modifiability, creative processes are supported through flexible game engines and tools, use of scripting and dynamic loading of assets, and feature-based teams with both creative and technical professions represented, and game developers are incrementally using more game-specific engines, tools and middleware in their development now compared to earlier.},

This is often a compromise, since they fulfill individual requirements only in parts, due to their different background. The decision for a specific engine can have a large effect on the effort required to implement own functionality. The number of existing engines further complicates decision making. To enable a comprehensible and replicable decision making, we propose a structured selection process. In a multi-step approach, first the requirements and criteria for comparison are identified and analyzed. A pre-filtering is then used to select a feasible number of engines which are then compared in detail.},

Compared to the rendering of 2D video within a 3D game scene, displaying S3D video includes some technical challenges related to rendering and adaption of the depth range. Rendering is exclusively possible on professional hardware not appropriate for gaming. Our approach, Multi-pass Stereoscopic Video Rendering (MSVR), allows to present stereoscopic video streams within game engines on consumer graphics boards. We further discuss aspects of performance and occlusion of virtual objects. This allows developers and other researchers to easily apply S3D video with current game engines to explore new innovations in S3D gaming.},

In this background, we conducted the research about the design for the collaborative visualization environment for the warfare simulation through commercial game engine. We define the requirements by analyzing advantages and disadvantages of existing tools or engines like SIMDIS or Vega, and propose the methods how to utilize the functionalities of commercial game engine to satisfy the requirements.

	abstract = {Human-computer interaction (HCI), especially in the games domain, targets to mimic as much as possible the natural human-to-human interaction, which is multimodal, involving speech, vision, haptic, etc. Furthermore, the domain of serious games, aiming to value-added games, makes use of additional inputs, such as biosensors, motion tracking equipment, etc. In this context, game development has become complex, expensive and burdened with a long development cycle. This creates barriers to independent game developers and inhibits the introduction of innovative games, or new game genres. In this paper the PlayMancer platform is introduced, a work in progress aiming to overcome such barriers by augmenting existing 3D game engines with innovative modes of interaction. Playmancer integrates open source existing systems, such as a game engine and a spoken dialog management system, extended by newly implemented components, supporting innovative interaction modalities, such as emotion recognition from audio data, motion tracking, etc, and advanced configuration tools.},

	abstract = {This study analyses one of the most popular game engines and an audio middleware to reproduce sound according to sound propagation physics. The analysis focuses on the transmission path between the sound source and the receiver. Even if there are several ready-to-use real-time auralization platforms and software, game engines' use with this aim is a recent study area for acousticians. However, audio design needs with game engines and the limits of their basic releases require additional tools (plugins and middleware) to improve both the quality and realism of sound in virtual environments. The paper discusses the use of Unreal Engine 4 and Wwise's 3D audio production methods in a set of different test environments. It assesses their performance in regard to a commercial geometrical acoustics software. The results show that the investigated version of the game engine and its sound assets are insufficient to simulate real-world cases and that significant improvements can be achieved with use of the middleware.},

	abstract = {Digital twin technologies have become popular in wind energy for monitoring and what-if scenario investigation. However, developing a digital representation of the wind is challenging, especially due to the digital twin platform constraints. Game engines might be possible to solve this issue, especially since game engines have been used for product design, testing, prototyping, and also digital twins. Therefore, this study investigates the potential of developing a digital twin of wind power in the Unreal game engine. A case study of two types of wind turbines (Vestas V164-8 and Enercon E-126 7.580) and one location (Esbjerg, Denmark) is chosen for this study. The digital twin includes the environment with historical wind data and the visual representation of the wind turbine with a wind power production model and the estimated production in the given wind conditions of the area. The results show that game engines are viable for building entire digital twins where a realistic graphical user interface is required. Unreal Engine 5 provides the tools for modelling the landscape, surrounding water, and lighting. In addition, the Unreal Engine ecosystem provides vast amounts of content, such as 3D assets and game logic plugins, easing the digital twin development. The results prove that digital twins built in Unreal Engine 5 have great potential development of digital twins and user interfaces for communicating with a digital twin. The developed digital twin allows for further extension to benefit future digital twins utilizing wind turbines.},
